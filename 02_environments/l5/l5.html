<section id="continental-drift">
<h2>Continental drift<a class="headerlink" href="#continental-drift" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Plate tectonics</strong> is often conflated with <strong>continental drift</strong>.
The latter idea that the continents, somehow, move with respect to one another is principally associated with Alfred Wegner (1880-1930). Early evidence was largely geological, with people observing similarities
in geological structures, rocks, and fossils between different continents.  No plausible physical mechanism was proposed,
with geologists evoking fantastical mechanisms without
any understanding or care for known physics. It is relevant that an understanding of the solid-state creep mechanisms that allow
the mantle to flow over geological time  first emerged within materials science in the mid 20th century. Until these ideas were in place,  the known forces acting on the Earth were vastly insufficient
to account for large scale motion of the continents. Nevertheless, this remains,  with, perhaps, some justification, an area in which geologists like to think they outsmarted  arrogant geophysicists.</p>

<section id="sea-floor-spreading">
<h2>Sea floor spreading<a class="headerlink" href="#sea-floor-spreading" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A key step towards plate tectonic theory was the <strong>sea floor
spreading hypothesis</strong>  due to  Harry Hess (1906-1969)
and Robert Dietz (1914-1995) in the USA. This is the idea that
new ocean floor is produced in central ocean ridges
and then spreads laterally, pushing the contients aside as it does so.
Looking at a  map of ocean bathymetry where we can see clear ocean ridges <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-02top"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3.39</span></a>, this may seem obvious, but detailed maps of the ocean floor were only gradually becoming available following the second world war.</p>

<p>The first conclusive evidence for sea floor spreading was provided through the
work of Fred Vine (1939-2024), Drum Matthews (1931-1997) in the UK,
and Lawrence Morley (1920-2013) in Canada. This idea depends on the observation
that the polarity of the Earth’s magnetic field undergoes episodic reversals.
These magnetic reversals can be recorded within certain types of rock (e.g.,
basaltic ocean floor which is comparatively rich in magntic minerals), and
their <strong>remnant magentism</strong> can be measured. Careful study
of such magnetic rocks coupled with radiometric dating of
allowed for a detailed geomagnetic time-scale
to be built back for hundreds of millions of years into the past.</p>
<p>Within the ocean basins,  remnant magnetism could be measured from ships, and variations with position were progressively mapped out. As this was being done, a striking observation emerged. In sections transverse to ridge axes,
a symmetric pattern of reversals could be seen on either side.
These observations were clearly consistent with sea floor spreading
from the ocean ridges, and, moreover, provided a quantitiative means
for dating the age of the ocean floor, and hence for quantifying the
spreading rates.</p>

<p>Before turning to the development of plate tectonics, it will be useful
to consider the relation between bathymetry and age  within the ocean basins. As we have seen, magnetic reversals in the
oceans provides a simple means for determining the age as
a function of position on the sea floor. Such a plot
is shown within <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-02age-depth"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3.41</span></a>, though note that the depth
is plotted as a function of the square root of age.
There is  significant scatter, linked principally to dynamic topography, but an  overall linear trend can be seen, with the depth
systematically increasing with age.</p>

<p>A quantitative explanation for the observed behaviour can be provided
at various levels of sophistication. Here we will  apply a simple
scaling argument along with an <strong>isostatic balance</strong>. This result
is interesting in of itself, but it will also help us
later understand one of the principle forces that drives plate motion.</p>
<p>Recall from the last lecture that the lithosphere comprises the
crust and upper part of the mantle that are cool enough to behave
elastically over geological time. As a result, heat transfer within
the lithosphere is dominantly through conduction. We also showed last time
that the time-scale for conductive cooling over a length-scale
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l\)</span> is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\newcommand{\ee}{\mathrm{e}}\newcommand{\ii}{\mathrm{i}}\newcommand{\ddns}{\,\mathrm{d}}
t \sim \frac{l^{2}}{\kappa}, \]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa\)</span> the thermal diffusivity.</p>
<p>At a mid ocean ridge new oceanic lithosphere is produced. This hot material then spreads laterally, and as it does so it cools,
becomes more dense, and  subsides. This is the basic mechanism that
explains the observed age-depth relation. To quantify this,
we assume that the lithosphere initially has the
same temperature as the underlying mantle, and hence the
same density, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{m}\)</span>. Over a time, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, this material
will have moved laterally to a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v t\)</span> from the
ridge, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> the spreading speed. In this time,
a thickness, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l \sim \sqrt{\kappa t}\)</span>, of the lithosphere
will have cooled to a lower density, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{l} = 
\alpha (T_{m} - T_{l}) \rho_{m}\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>
the thermal expansivity and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{l}\)</span> the lithospheric
temperature.
This situation is summarised graphically in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-02ocean-cooling"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3.42</span></a>.
Note that a more sophisticated treatment would
solve the heat conduction equation to
determine the variation of temperature, and
hence density with depth.</p>

</figure>
<p>To determine the subsidence associated with the cooling
of the lithosphere, we apply an isostatic balance. This
is the idea that at a certain <strong>compensation depth</strong> within the mantle
the  pressure within each vertical column should be equal.
Assuming that the acceleration due to gravity does not vary
significantly, equality of pressure is the same as
the balance of mass per unit area, and hence we are led to the</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\rho_{w} h_{0} + \rho_{m}(h+l) = \rho_{w} h + \rho_{l} l, \]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{w}\)</span> is the density of water, and  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{0}\)</span> the
water depth at the ridge. Solving for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span>,
we find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[h = h_{0} + \frac{\rho_{l}-\rho_{m}}{\rho_{m}-\rho_{w}}l, \]</div>
<p>and hence we arrive at</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[h = h_{0} + \frac{\alpha (T_{m}-T_{l})\rho_{m} \sqrt{\kappa t}}{\rho_{m}-\rho_{w}}, \]</div>
<p>where we can see the square-root of time dependence.</p>
<p>The model just described predicts that the lithosphere gets
thicker and thicker as it ages. In reality, the underlying mantle acts
as a heat source. This places an upper bound on the
lithospheric thickness, and the  and
the ocean floor is found to level off at large  ages (greater than around 80 Ma).</p>

<section id="plate-kinematics">
<h2>Plate kinematics<a class="headerlink" href="#plate-kinematics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Plate tectonics views the surface of the Earth as being split into a relatively small number of rigid plates that undergo relative motion.
In particular, the deformation necessary to accommodate this motion
is limited to thin regions around the plate boundaries. Importaly, plate tectonics is a kinematic theory that explains the manner in which
these plates must move, but it does not explain <em>why</em> they move.</p>
<p>It is worth remembering that the question of whether or not a planet has plate tectonics is asking whether a specific kinematic model  is relevant to understanding its behaviour. Indeed, plate tectonics arose in the late 1960s, and by the 1970s it was clear that this theory is only really applicable within the oceans. The behaviour of
the continents is significantly more complicated, with
broad regions of diffuse deformation seen within their interiors.
This led to the development of various theories for <strong>continental
tectonics</strong>, though there is not time to discuss any of them.</p>

<p>The central idea of plate tectonics is that the plates are rigid,
which is to say that they do not undergo appreicable internal deformation.  We can view each plate as an irregularly shaped
spherical cap on the Earth’s surface. It is a result of geometry that the only possible motion of
such a rigid spherical cap is a rotation about the Earth’s centre. Thus, at an instance in time, the kinematic description of
plate motion is reduced to specifying a set of rotation axes and
mangitudes.  Using this geometric insight,  McKenzie and Parker (1967)  and Morgan (1968) independently showed that observed surface motions (inferred from a range of proxies) were consistent with
the plate tectonic model.</p>

<h2>Earthquakes and Subduction zones<a class="headerlink" href="#earthquakes-and-subduction-zones" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Within the early history of plate tectonics, a prominent
role was played by <strong>earthquake seismology</strong>. This is
firstly because earthquakes occur at plate boundaries
in response to their relative motion, and hence
earthquake locations can be used to delineate plate
boundaries. A modern example of such a map is
shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-02earthquakes"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3.45</span></a>. As with the earlier plot of
ocean bathymetry, when looking at such a figure it
is hard not to think the reality of plate tectonics is
entirely obvious, but global maps of seismicity were
only just emerging when plate tectonic theory was developed.</p>

<p>As well as locations, seismological methods also provide information
on the sense of relative motion that caused an earthquake.
There is not time to discuss how this method works, but the
directions provided were  data for testing plate tectonic
theory, and hence for determining rotation poles for the different
tectonic plates.</p>
<p>A particularly important example of this is in the
study of <strong>subduction zones</strong>. More will be said about subduction
zones later in the course, considering in particular their
role in volcanism and in chemical cycles between the
Earth’s surface and mantle. For the moment, we can think of them
simplistically as areas, generally at the margins of
ocean basins where the oceanic lithosphere has cooled sufficiently to
become unstable and sink into the convecting mantle below.  The
path of these subducted slabs into the mantle is delineated by
earthquakes, with the inferred senses of motions  being consistent
with our interpretation.</p>

<section id="plate-dynamics">
<h2>Plate dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#plate-dynamics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We have now summarised the observational evidence that
led people to accept plate tectonics as a kinematic theory
that well describes the relative motions seen within ocean regions
and some continental ones. But what causes this surface
motion, and how does it relate to convection in the mantle
below?</p>
<p>The first thing to say is that plate motions do not
simple reflect convective motions in the mantle.
Such a simplistic view is commonly shown in
textbook cartoons, but observations show clearly
that things are more complicated. For example,
there are locations at the margins of the Pacific  were
mid ocean ridges are being actively subducted!
It is for this reason that the speed at which
plates move cannot be straightforwardly
identified with the speed of the convecting
mantle, though their orders of magnitudes are
still expected to be similar.</p>
<p>There are thought to be three principle mechanisms that
drive oceanic plates. In each case, simple quantitiative
models can be developed, but we will just sumarise the
basic ideas.</p>
<p>First, there is <strong>ridge push</strong>. This is the force linked to the
lateral pressure gradient that exists between the ridge axis
and older sea floor that has cooled and subsided. The
existence of such a force can be readily
understood by looking back to <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-02ocean-cooling"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3.42</span></a>.</p>
<p>The next force is known as <strong>slab pull</strong>. This is the negative
buoyancy force transmitted from a subducted part of the slab
to the rest of the plate.</p>
<p>Finally, there is <strong>viscous drag</strong>, this  being the
horizontal force applied to the base of the lithosphere
by the flow of the underlying mantle.</p>
<p>The relative importance of these different forces can be assessed
using a range of methods and observations. For example, if
slab pull is important, we would expect the typical speed of
plates to increase as a function of their boundary being subducted,
and this is indeed seems to be the case.</p>
<p>The key point for us to understand is that while the
motion of the plates does, ultimately, result from the
convection in the mantle, the precise relation
between these processes is complicated, with plate
speeds and directions not providing a direct view of the
underlying mantle flow.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-plate-tectonics-an-inevitable-consequence-of-mantle-convection">
<h2>Is plate tectonics an inevitable consequence of mantle convection?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-plate-tectonics-an-inevitable-consequence-of-mantle-convection" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>No. This is shown clearly by looking at Mars and Venus.
Both planets are of a similar size and age to the Earth,
and it is certain that their mantles are undergoing active convection.
But neither has plate tectonics. On Mars there are a few surface features that resemble those produced by plate tectonics, and it is possible that in the past its behaviour was more similar to the Earth. Vensus, on the other hand, seems to be entirely different from the Earth, with no sign of tectonic plates.</p>
<p>The big question are, therefore, why the Earth has plate tectonics,
why other similar planets do not, and what range of tectonic behaviours might arise. This is a difficult questions that can only be partially answered. At present, it is not even possible to self-consistently model
and understand plate tectonics on the Earth. This is not an issue of the basic physics, but of the appropriate rheology for the Earth’s mantle and lithosphere.  We have seen that within the lithosphere
deformation is strongly localised to  regions along plate boundaries. Within complicated numerical simulations, it has been possible to replicate this plate like behaviour, but only by “hard coding”
weak areas along the plate boundaries.</p>
<p>The precise mechanisms by which plate boundaries form is largely unknown. There are certainly good ideas, but none are
yet conclusive. One interesting idea is that of a <strong>damage rheology</strong>, with lithospheric material being gradually weakened as it is deformed through processes such as grain size reduction (e.g., Bercovici &amp; Ricard 2014). Areas that have been weakened undergo greater deformation
in response to forcing, and hence tend to weaken further. This provides a feedback mechanism by which  deformation can localise within narrow regions.</p>
<p>Rheological differences are, presumably, the factor that leads to different behaviour between the Earth and similar planets such as
Mars and Venus. Here seemingly subtle points could be very important.
For example, the Earth has surface water, with this water cycled through
the mantle through ocean ridges and subduction. A small amount of
water, in the form of hydrous minerals, within mantle material
is known from experiments to have a substantial effect on
their rheological behaviour. It is possible that Venus
does not have plate tectonics because it lost its surface
water early in its history, and as a result, its lithosphere
is too strong to break into plates.</p>
<p>Clearly these are not settled matters. From the perspective of a planetary scientist musing about the interior dynamics exoplanet
it is, however, important to know and remember that the behaviour of the
Earth’s mantle is not fully understood and cannot be self-consistently modelled. This should serve as  a note of caution for to those inclined to run complicated numerical convection codes within a new parameter
regime  in the hope of learning something new.</p>
