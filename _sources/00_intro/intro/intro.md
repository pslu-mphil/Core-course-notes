The Moon is visible faintly below Earth.  This image emphasises that our exploration of the cosmos is inevitably rooted in the understanding of physics, chemistry and biology gleaned from Earth.

The core course asks two major questions:
- How did life emerge on Earth?
- How do we find life elsewhere?

To answer these questions requires bringing together expertise from the Astrophysics, Earth Sciences, Chemistry, and Biology communities.  They are questions that need us to reconstruct Earth's own history, from its assembly in the sun's protoplanetary disk, through to its earliest climate, and on to the emergence of animals and technological life.  By comparison to Earth's terrestrial neighbours, and their strikingly different fates, we need to take these insights and generalise them to models of how planets may acquire and maintain **{term}`habitability`**.  As exoplanetary science has shown us, the diversity of worlds outside the solar system is striking, so the frontier of habitability may lie in conditions unlike any we have experience of from the solar system.  

These questions test our creativity and imaginations in searching for life elsewhere.  The core courses are designed to provide an overview of the key contributions that multiple disciplines can make to this search.

## Table of contents for the module introductions
The core course is split into four modules of 12 lectures each.  Each module is also introduced with an overview lecture, placing the lectures in their broader context.  The notes for these overview lectures are given here.

## How to use the course notes
The notes presented here are a complementary resource to the lectures.  They are not intended to be a verbatim account of what is said in the lectures.  Instead, they offer an additional resource that touches on material in the lectures from the distinct angle afforded by written, as opposed to oral, communication.  The notes may share common graphs with the lectures, or choose different images to illustrate the same concepts.  We hope that by seeing similar content in different forms, you will find a style that best fits your learning.  Importantly, you have access to the lecture recordings and the lecture slides through [moodle](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=254682) to use alongside these notes.

Each lecture is accompanied by notes that you will find on this site.  If you find any errors or issues with the notes please contact the relevant lecturer (whose contact details will be at the top of the corresponding page) and the [Course Coordinator](mailto:pslu-mphil@ast.cam.ac.uk) so we can correct these.

The notes are accompanied by a [glossary](../../reference/glossary.md) that attempts to define some of the more common terms in the highly diverse discipline of planetary science and life in the Universe.  Undoubtedly terms are missing, and if you think a really important term should be added that is being used in the notes, please let us know and we would be happy to include it.
