# Biospheres (C4)

Understanding the biology of life in the Universe is very different to the other modules you have covered because currently astrobiology doesn’t exist – that is we do not currently have life outside this planet, i.e. no astrobiology.   This means that studying astrobiology is fundamentally different because you can’t actually learn about the biology outside the earth, so instead we have to focus on life on earth and the inferences we can make from that.  Note that lots of the questions we would like to know for astrobiology are the really big questions in evolutionary biology and ecology, which we need to be aware of when we start to consider what life would look like elsewhere. 
This course will cover the chemical basis for life, the evolution from protocells to LUCA to  animals, and finish with considering how we can go about understanding extra-terrestrial life.
