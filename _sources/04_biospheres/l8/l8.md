# Origins of Eukaryotes (chloroplasts, mitos)
**– mitochondria and chloroplasts (plastids)**

Professor: **[Chris Howe](mailto:jmh65@cam.ac.uk)** ([Biochemistry](https://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/research/howe))

```{highlights}

**Learning objectives:**
- To understand the origin of mitochondria and their presence throughout eukaryotes
- To understand the origins and spread of chloroplasts

```

**Key Concepts**
- Mitochondria as endosymbionts
- Acquisition of mitochondria may mark the origin of eukaryotes
- Plastids (chloroplasts) as endosymbionts
- There are multiple instances of lateral acquisition of plastids
- Acquisition of plastids and mitochondria provided metabolic benefits to the host
- After endosymbiosis there was large-scale remodelling of genomes and other aspects of cell biology

## Introduction
We can divide organisms into three groups:

- Bacteria (also referred to as ‘eubacteria’ in some sources)
- Archaea
- Eukaryotes

The eukaryotes (which include you and me) typically have a range of complex intracellular structures, or organelles, including a nucleus and mitochondria (organelles that produce useful energy from carbon-containing molecules). Photosynthetic eukaryotes (plants and algae) also have chloroplasts, which is where photosynthesis happens.

`````{admonition} A note on terminology
There are also photosynthetic bacteria – cyanobacteria. Some people include them in ‘algae’. For the sake of simplicity, we won’t here.

Chloroplasts are interconvertible with a range of other organelles in plants, such as amyloplasts and chromoplasts. We’ll use the collective term ‘plastids’ to include all those, as well as the algal organelles.

We’re going to look at the origins of mitochondria and plastids. That will also tell us something about the origin of eukaryotes, and what might happen with other cellular life forms. We’ll look at the following questions:

- How did mitochondria originate?
- How is that linked to the origin of eukaryotes?
- How did plastids originate?
- Is this kind of thing common?
- What were the driving forces?
- How have mitochondria and plastids evolved after their origin?

## How did mitochondria originate?
Since the mid-19th century microscopists had noted similarities between mitochondria and bacteria, leading to the idea of them as endosymbionts.

The identification and characterisation of DNA in the mitochondria and other biochemical features strongly supported this (Fig. {numref}`fig:c4_8_endosymbiosis`).

Though, other possible explanations existed, such as specialisation of a region of cell membrane, followed by enclosure and capture of relevant genes (Fig. {numref}`fig:c4_8_specialisation`).

Sequence analysis of DNA indicates a close relationship with alpha-proteobacteria, and possibly even within them... though some analyses disagree.

## How is that linked to the origin of eukaryotes?
This is tied up with the question of what was the host. 

Early studies pointed to a group of anaerobic protists that appeared to diverge early in the eukaryotic tree, such as _Giardia_, _Trichomonas_ and _Entamoeba_. They were sometimes referred to as ‘Archaezoa’.

It was thought they are representatives of eukaryote lineages diverging before the origin of mitochondria:
