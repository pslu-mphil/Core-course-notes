**Learning objectives:**
- To understand the origin of mitochondria and their presence throughout eukaryotes
- To understand the origins and spread of chloroplasts

```

**Key Concepts**
- Mitochondria as endosymbionts
- Acquisition of mitochondria may mark the origin of eukaryotes
- Plastids (chloroplasts) as endosymbionts
- There are multiple instances of lateral acquisition of plastids
- Acquisition of plastids and mitochondria provided metabolic benefits to the host
- After endosymbiosis there was large-scale remodelling of genomes and other aspects of cell biology

## Introduction
We can divide organisms into three groups:

- Bacteria (also referred to as ‘eubacteria’ in some sources)
- Archaea
- Eukaryotes

The eukaryotes (which include you and me) typically have a range of complex intracellular structures, or organelles, including a nucleus and mitochondria (organelles that produce useful energy from carbon-containing molecules). Photosynthetic eukaryotes (plants and algae) also have chloroplasts, which is where photosynthesis happens.

`````{admonition} A note on terminology
There are also photosynthetic bacteria – cyanobacteria. Some people include them in ‘algae’. For the sake of simplicity, we won’t here.
`````

Chloroplasts are interconvertible with a range of other organelles in plants, such as amyloplasts and chromoplasts. We’ll use the collective term ‘plastids’ to include all those, as well as the algal organelles.

We’re going to look at the origins of mitochondria and plastids. That will also tell us something about the origin of eukaryotes, and what might happen with other cellular life forms. We’ll look at the following questions:

- How did mitochondria originate?
- How is that linked to the origin of eukaryotes?
- How did plastids originate?
- Is this kind of thing common?
- What were the driving forces?
- How have mitochondria and plastids evolved after their origin?

## How did mitochondria originate?
Since the mid-19th century microscopists had noted similarities between mitochondria and bacteria, leading to the idea of them as endosymbionts.

The identification and characterisation of DNA in the mitochondria and other biochemical features strongly supported this (Fig. {numref}`fig:c4_8_endosymbiosis`).

```

Though, other possible explanations existed, such as specialisation of a region of cell membrane, followed by enclosure and capture of relevant genes (Fig. {numref}`fig:c4_8_specialisation`).

Sequence analysis of DNA indicates a close relationship with alpha-proteobacteria, and possibly even within them... though some analyses disagree.

```

## How is that linked to the origin of eukaryotes?
This is tied up with the question of what was the host. 

Early studies pointed to a group of anaerobic protists that appeared to diverge early in the eukaryotic tree, such as _Giardia_, _Trichomonas_ and _Entamoeba_. They were sometimes referred to as ‘Archaezoa’.

It was thought they are representatives of eukaryote lineages diverging before the origin of mitochondria:

```

But we now recognise (i) the trees were in error as to where they placed the Archezoa, and (ii) they have remnant mitochondria anyway, which don’t function in aerobic respiration, but are definitely of mitochondrial ancestry.

In fact **all** eukaryotes have mitochondria (or used to). 

So the origin of mitochondria (rather than the nucleus) may mark the origin of eukaryotes.

Recent studies have indicated the existence of a group of archaea, the Asgardarchaeota, which have many features in common with eukaryotes. They group as a sister to eukaryotes in phylogenetic trees.

```

So it seems that some eukaryote-like features arose in those archaea. A lineage acquired mitochondria and nuclei (could be in either order), and that resulted in the eukaryotes as we know them.

## How did plastids originate?
As with mitochondria, ultrastructural data from the 19th Century were strongly supported by the demonstration of plastid DNA and its characterisation from the 1980s onwards.

The organization of genes in the plastid is even more similar to that of bacteria than for mitochondrial genes. There are many examples of genes in operons, and even in the same order in those operons as in bacteria. The plastid RNA polymerase is similar to bacterial RNA polymerases.

Sequence-based trees indicate an origin of plastids in the cyanobacteria.

Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria carry out a very similar kind of photosynthesis. The origin of chloroplasts from something related to present-day cyanobacteria seems beyond doubt.

The figure above refers to ‘chloroplasts’, as early studies looked at DNA in the plastids, usually chloroplasts, of green plants and green algae. We’ll look below at the origin of the plastids/chloroplasts in, say, red algae or diatoms.

## Is this kind of thing common?
Are these endosymbiosis-derived organelles freak events, or are they common? If they’re common, we might expect to see them in other cellular systems we encounter.

**Mitochondria**
All eukaryotes have a nucleus and mitochondria (or had them). So it seems that acquiring mitochondria was a one-off event early in the history if eukaryotes. It was a very successful event, though, given the diversity of eukaryotes.


**Plastids**
This is a more complicated story.

We can define plastids as primary or complex ones.

The primary ones have two membranes round them. Complex ones have more – usually three or four. Primary plastids are derived directly from endosymbiotic acquisition of a photosynthetic bacterium.

Primary ones are found in plants and green algae, red algae, and an unusual group called the glaucophytes. The plants and green algae have different pigment composition from the others. 

The general view is that the primary plastids have a single origin – “monophyletic” (left hand panel below), rather than “polyphyletic” (right hand panel) in spite of the differences in pigment composition. This is based on the plastids apparently having a common import machinery.

The complex plastids arose by secondary endosymbiosis, in which a non-photosynthetic host acquired a photosynthetic eukaryote, and kept the plastid.
