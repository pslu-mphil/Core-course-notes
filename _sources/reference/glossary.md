```{glossary}

Abiotic
    Deriving from physical/chemical processes without the involvement of life.

Accrete
    To gain mass.

Accretion
    The process whereby an object, such as a planet, gains mass. 

Astronomical unit
    The mean Earth - Sun distance, ~150 million kilometers.

Autotroph
    An organism using inorganic energy sources (sunlight, energy from rocks) to convert inorganic carbon compounds (e.g., CO2) to organic compounds and energy.

Biosignature
    Any observable that can be attributed to the action of life, although it may not on its own be definitive evidence of life.  In this respect fossils are a biosignature, although only thought of as such as we try and push back the earliest evidence for life on Earth.  In the context of exoplanets, trace atmospheric gasses are the most frequently considered type of biosignature.  SETI's survey for radio emission from extraterrestrial technological life also a biosignature search.   

Bulk silicate Earth
    The integrated composition of Earth's non-core reservoirs, i.e., atmosphere + oceans + crust + mantle.

CAI
    Calcium-aluminium rich inclusions are found in certain un-**{term}`differentiated`** meteorites (particularly carbonaceous **{term}`chondrite`**s).  These grains contain the first minerals to condense out of a cooling nebular gas, thought to occur after our Sun began to fuse hydrogen.  Age dating of these grains shows them to be the oldest solids formed in the solar system at 4.5673 billion years old [Connelly+2012](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1226919).

Chondrite
    A class of un-**{term}`differentiated`** meteorites, including the 'carbonaceous', 'ordinary', and 'enstatite' chondrites.  So named because of they contain chondrules, spheres of silicate mineral presumed to have grown from blobs of melt.

Crust
    The outer, chemically distinct, layer of a planet forms from magmas ultimately derived from the planet's mantle undergoing incomplete (i.e., 'partial') melting and that melt moving towards the surface where it solidifies to crust.

Debris belts
    Regions around a star containing material left over from planet formation, such as the asteroid belt in our solar system, or the [Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt).

Differentiated
    See **{term}`differentiation`**.

Differentiation
    The process whereby a rocky planet segregates its internal structure into a **{term}`metal`**-rich core and **{term}`silicate`**-dominated mantle.  Can potentially proceed further to the formation of **{term}`crust`s** and atmospheres.

Equilibrium temperature
    The blackbody temperature of an object (planet) at equilibrium between incident and emitted electromagnetic radiation.

Fugacity
    The effective partial pressure of a gas, taking into account non-ideality (i.e., inter molecular interactions).  Often fugacities are given in bar ($\mathrm{10^5}$ Pa), and with a reference state chosen at 1 bar, are numerically equivalent to activity (where the relationship between activity and fugacity is $a=f/f_0$, where f_0 is the reference state).

Habitable
    The property of being able to host life.  Typically thought of in the context of the presence of liquid water, given the needs of life on Earth, but in principle a concept that could be generalised if more chemically physically tolerant life is discovered.  

Habitability
    See **{term}`habitable`**.

Habitable zone
    That region around a star where climatic conditions could in principle be maintained on a rocky planet such that liquid water is stable at its surface.

Heterotroph
    An organism that runs its metabolic processes using input, e.g., reduced organic carbon, from other organisms.  Contrast with autotroph.

Hill radius
    The radial distance from a planet within which its own gravitational force is dominant, e.g., in affecting the orbit of pebble-sized material passing near it.  Defined as $R_H = a(m/(M+m))^{1/3}$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet, $M$ is the mass of the star, and $m$ is the mass of the planet.

Hill sphere
    The 3D region described by a planet's **{term}`Hill radius`**.

Hot Jupiter
    A planet of roughly Jupiter's mass (~300 Earth masses) that is highly irradiated by its host star, and consequently has a high **{term}`equilibrium temperature`**.  These planets typically have orbital periods $<$10 days.

Ice
    In the context of planets, 'ice' is used to refer to molecular components such as water ($\sf H_2O$), ammonia ($\sf NH_3$), and methane ($\sf CH_4$), i.e., species heavier than $\sf H_2$, the dominant gas-phase constituent of **{term}`protoplanetary disk`s**.  These species, which might be gas in the inner hot regions of a **{term}`protoplanetary disk`**, will condense beyond their respective **{term}`ice line`s**, forming part of the solid building blocks of planets.

Ice line
    The radial location in a **{term}`protoplanetary disk`** where a gas phase species condenses into a solid phase, an 'ice'.  E.g., the water ice line in the solar system is thought to have been located around the orbit of Jupiter.

Igneous
    A rock that formed by solidification of a magma.

Instellation
    The amount of light received by a planet from its host star.  Units of $\text{Wm}^{-2}$.

Magma
    A molten silicate liquid, possibly containing crystals and gas bubbles.

Magma ocean
    When there is an extensive and sustained body of magma at a planet's surface.  Such as is created from a giant impact, from the heat of accretion early in a planet's life, or may be sustained permanently on irradiated exoplanets.

Main sequence
    That period of a star's life during which it is fusing H in its core into heavier elements.  The main sequence lasts for different lengths of time according to stellar mass, with more massive stars fusing H faster and so having shorter lives.  For reference, the main sequence lifetime of our Sun will be approximately 10 billion years.

Mantle
    The rocky interior to a planet beneath its crust, typically comprising most of the non-**{term}`metal`** mass of a rocky planet.

Mantle plume
    An buoyant upwelling of rock withing a planet's mantle, often triggering volcanism at the surface.  The buoyancy is typically driven by the upwelling being hotter than the surrounding mantle.  Such thermal upwellings originate at thermal boundary layers in the planet, e.g., at the core mantle boundary.

Metal
    This is one of those words that means different things to different communities.  For astrophysicists, this can mean 'elements heavier than He', i.e., most of the periodic table.  For Earth and Planetary Scientists, 'metal' refers to material properties of matter, meaning a material like iron or iron alloys (Earth's core being a notable example), with high thermal and electrical conductivity.  

Metallicity
	For astronomers, the metallicity of a star, refers to the metal content of that star. Iron is the element normally used to trace metallicity, with the ratio of iron to hydrogen in the star, relative to solar, used to describe the metallicity, [Fe/H]

Metamorphism
    The transformed of a rock by pressure and/or temperature into a new mineral assemblage, with possible textural modification as well, e.g., the generation of banding or shearing.

Metamorphosed
    See metamorphism.

Nucleosynthesis
    The formation of elements in either primordial 'big-bang' nucleosynthesis (producing hydrogen, helium and lithium), or stellar nucleosynthesis.  The latter is now recognised to include a range of processes from nuclear fusion in stellar cores, nuetron capture in stellar envelopes, and neutron star merger events.

Mid-ocean ridge
    The topographic expression of two tectonic plates pulling apart

Partial melting
    The process in any multi-component system whereby the solid reacts to form a liquid of one composition and a residual solid of another composition.  Added together, liquid and solid have the same composition as the whole system, by mass conservation.  The distinct physical chemical properties of the liquid and solid, however, allow differentiation to operate to produce, for example, compositionally distinct planetary crusts.

Partial pressure
    In a mixed gas, the partial pressure is the pressure that a an individual gas in the mixture would have on its own, if it were the only gas filling the volume.  For an ideal gas, i.e., one where intermolecular forces can be ignored, then the total pressure $p$, is equal to the sum of the partial pressures, and the partial pressure of gas $i$ is given by $p_i = x_i \cdot p$, by the product of the mole fraction of the molecule in the mixed gas with the total pressure.

Pebble accretion
    A regime of planetary {term}`accretion` in which aerodynamic drag enhances the rate of solid mass gain by a growing planet.  The need for aerodynamic interaction between the accreting material and the gas of the protoplanetary disk means that this accretion mechanism is only efficient for solids with a radius that moderately couples them to the flow of the gas (i.e., 'pebbles'): larger objects feel insufficient drag, whereas very small material is coupled to the gas and swept past the growing planet.

Pebble isolation mass
    The mass a planet reaches at which point it can no longer accrete pebbles from the environment around it, having already accreted those in its immediate vicinity.

Phase
    A chemically uniform and physically distinct region of matter.  For example, a rain drop is a distinct phase compared with the air it falls through; an ice cube is a distinct phase from the water it floats on; and in a granite, each type of mineral present, quartz, feldspare etc. are distinct phases. 

Planetesimal
    An object held together under its own self-gravity, of order kilometers to hundreds of kilometers in size.  Can be **{term}`differentiated`**, or not.

Plate tectonics
    The movement of rigid plates across the surface of a planet, with deformation localised to their margins (e.g., subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges).

Protoplanetary disk
    The disk-shaped annulus of gas and dust surrounding a young star out of which planets form.  The ratio of gas to dust in protoplanetary disks is roughly 100:1 by mass, and their lifetimes are of order 10 million years.  

Radial drift
    The movement towards or away from the star of solid material in a **{term}`protoplanetary disk`**.  This movement occurs due to the rotation of the gas in the protoplanetary disk being generally slower than the orbital velocity required to avoid falling inwards (due to the gas being supported by pressure as well as its orbital speed).  The result is for solids to drift inwards as they experience a headwind trying to move through the slow moving gas.  

Reducing
    A substance that has a propensity to donate electrons to another material, thereby 'reducing' it.  E.g., in placing iron metal, Fe, next to water, H$_2$O, the iron metal can reduce the water by the reaction $\text{Fe} + \text{H}_2\text{O} = \text{H}_2 + \text{FeO}$.

Semi-major axis
    The longest radius of an ellipse and mean distance of an object from its primary, e.g., a planet from its star, or satellite from its planet.

Siderophile
    An element with an affinity for moving into the metal **{term}`phase`**.  E.g., Fe, Ni, Pt.

Silicate
    A mineral whose major structural unit comprises Si-O bonds.  E.g., quartz, or olivine, the latter being a major constituent of shallow planetary **{term}`mantle`s**.

Short lived radionuclide
    A radioisotope that decays sufficiently rapidly that, as of today, no natural occurrence of the isotope exists, i.e., it is 'extinct'.  Notable examples include $\mathrm{^{26}Al}$, which drove heating and differentiation of planetesimals in the early solar system.

Subduction
    The process whereby a tectonic plate is pushed into the interior of a planet.  Only known to have happened on Earth.

Tectonic plate
    A rigid outer layer to a planet bounded by regions where it is being created (mid-ocean ridge), subducting, or slipping past another plate.  Only known to operate on Earth.

Unconformity
    A gap in time.
