**Learning objectives:**
- The Earth's mantle exhibits a time-dependent rheology. Over time-scales of millions of years, it behaves like a viscous fluid. 
- Viscosity is a strongly decreasing function of temperature. The cool outer part of the Earth is known as the lithosphere, and  responds elastic over geological time. It is the warmer regions below the lithosphere that undergo convection. 
- Scaling analysis to derive the Rayleigh number and understand its implications. 
- The Earth's mantle has a high Rayleigh number, and so must undergo vigorous time-dependent convection over a range 
of length-scales. 
- Convection in the mantle contributes to long-wavelength gravity anomalies and dynamic topography at the Earth's surface.

## Introduction

The aim of this lecture is to summarise the key physical principles governing convection within the Earth's mantle. Though our focus is on the Earth, the same rules, presumably, apply within other Earth-like planets. 


## Mantle rheology

Mantle convection  can be understood in terms 
of fluid mechanics. But the Earth's mantle is very much a solid. This apparent contradiction is resolved by the mantle's time-dependent rheology: over short timescales (like for seismic waves) it is a solid, but over geological timescales, it flows like a very viscous fluid. 
To understand this, we need to consider the rheological behaviour 
of the mantle. By the  **rheology** of a material we mean the quantitative 
relationship between deformation and stress. The key idea is that the mantle exhibits a 
**time-dependent** rheology, this meaning, roughly, that the 
response to forcing depends on the time-scale over which 
it is applied. 

 Within the following discussion we will write $\sigma$ for the stress
and $\epsilon$ for the strain. Strictly, these are 
tensor-fields, but this is not important for the moment. 


### End member behaviour

To begin, we consider two simple rheologies that 
describe the end-member behaviour of the mantle. 
Within an **elastic solid**, stress and strain are 
related by **Hooke's law** which we write as
```{math}
\newcommand{\ee}{\mathrm{e}}\newcommand{\ii}{\mathrm{i}}\newcommand{\ddns}{\,\mathrm{d}}
\sigma = \mu \epsilon, 
```
with $\mu$ an elastic modulus. Here we see that the 
application of a constant force (and hence stress) results
in a constant strain. If the force is removed, the strain 
then returns to zero. 

In a **Newtonian fluid** stress is proportional to the 
time-derivative of the strain (usually called the **strain-rate**), 
and hence we can write
```{math}
\sigma = \eta \dot{\epsilon}, 
```
where $\eta$ is the viscosity and a dot is used to 
denote time-differentiation. If a constant force is 
applied to such a material, there is a constant strain-rate, and hence the strain grows linearly with time. 
If the force is removed the strain-rate goes to zero, but 
there will be an accumulated strain. Within a fluid, transient 
forces can result in permanent deformation. 

### Maxwell solids

The simplest working model for the mantle's rheology is that 
of a **Maxwell solid**. In this case, the relation between 
stress and strain can be written
```{math}
\dot{\sigma} + \tau^{-1} \sigma = \mu \dot{\epsilon}
```
Here $\tau$ is a constant known as the  **relaxation time** and $\mu$
is an elastic modulus. 

To gain insight into the behaviour of such a material, suppose
that the strain is initially zero, that at time $0$ 
it jumps to a finite value $\epsilon_{0}$, then is
 held constant. If we integrate the above relation
over the interval $(-\delta,\delta)$ and let $\delta \rightarrow 0$, 
we find that the stress at time $t=0$ undergoes a finite-jump 
to the value $\sigma_{0} = \mu \epsilon_{0}$. Note that 
the stress generated is equal to that that would be 
seen within an elastic material with modulus $\mu$.
Using this  initial elastic value for the stress, we can then solve the ODE for $t> 0$ 
to obtain
```{math}
\sigma(t) = \sigma_{0} \ee^{-t/\tau}, 
```
This shows that the initial stress decreases exponentially at a rate set by the relaxation time. 

Such behaviour is representative of that occurring within crystalline materials. The 
initial elastic response to the applied strain can be understood 
in terms of deformation of the crystal lattice. Subsequently, 
stresses are relaxed through the movement of lattice defects, 
with these motions occurring over a characteristic relaxation time.
In fact, within a real crystal there will 
typically be a host of different mechanisms, and so it is 
more correct to think of a **spectrum of relaxation times**
and not just the single value present within the Maxwell model.
An important example of such a mechanism is the migration of
lattice vacancies in response to an applied stress. This process, which is  known as **diffusion creep**, is thought to be the pricinple 
mechanism by which the mantle flows over geological time.

the overall stress is lowered, and further macroscopic
deformation occurs. There are several 
mechanisms by which vacancies can move, including 
diffusion through the crystal interior (Nabarro-Herring Creep)
or along grain boundaries (Coble Creep). Figure taken from
Bhadeshia (2003)
```

To gain further insight into the behaviour of a Maxwell
solid, we can consider its response to a time-harmonic 
forcing. In this case, we can express the stress and 
strain as in the form
```{math}
\sigma(t) = \tilde{\sigma} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t}, \quad 
\epsilon(t) = \tilde{\epsilon} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t}, 
```
with $\omega$ the oscillation frequency, and tilded terms 
the amplitudes. Note that the use of complex numbers is for convenience, and it is the real parts that are physically meaningful. Putting the 
above expressions into the governing relation for a Maxwell
solid, we obtain
```{math}
\tilde{\sigma} = \tilde{\mu}(\omega) \tilde{\epsilon}, 
```
where we have introduced a frequency-dependent **viscoelastic
modulus**
```{math}
\tilde{\mu}(\omega) = \frac{\mathrm{i}\omega\tau }{\mathrm{i}\omega\tau + 1} \mu.
```
This shows that the constant of proportionality  between the stress and strain amplitudes is 
both frequency-dependent and complex valued. The latter feature is associated with a phase delay between forcing and response, though
this property is not crucial to our present discussion. It is this 
frequency-dependence, however, that makes precise the idea of
a time-dependent rheology. In particular, we can now examine
quantitatively the  low and high-frequency limiting behaviour 
of a Maxwell solid.

High-frequencies are those for which $\omega \tau \gg 1$, and in such 
cases we have the approximate relation
```{math}
\tilde{\sigma} \approx \mu \tilde{\epsilon}, 
```
this being identical to what would be seen within an 
elastic solid. Thus, when the material is deformed at a rate 
that is fast relative to the relaxation time, it behaves like 
an elastic solid.  Conversely, at low-frequencies, we have
$\omega \tau \ll 1$, in which case 
```{math}
\tilde{\sigma} \approx \mathrm{i}\omega \mu \tau \tilde{\epsilon}. 
```
Noting that $\mathrm{i}\omega \tilde{\epsilon}$ is the amplitude of the 
strain-rate, we see that the behaviour is that of a Newtonian 
fluid with viscosity 
```{math}
\eta = \mu \tau.
```


### More general viscoelastic rheologies

We have now shown that a Maxwell solid has the correct limiting 
behaviours seen within the Earth's mantle. More detailed observations 
make clear that the mantle's rheology is more complicated. 
Indeed, we noted above that within real crystals there will 
typically be a whole spectrum of relaxation times associated with 
different microscopic mechanisms. Nonetheless, the same 
form of low-frequency limiting behaviour of a Newtonian fluid 
can be expected under reasonable assumptions. To see this, suppose that the 
viscoelastic modulus for a Maxwell solid is generalised to 
```{math}
\tilde{\mu}(\omega) = \int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}} \frac{\mathrm{i}\omega\tau }{\mathrm{i}\omega\tau + 1} m(\tau) \dd \tau, 
```
with $m(\tau)$ a function that quantifies the relaxation 
spectrum which we assume is limited to the range $0 < \tau_{1} \le \tau_{2} < \infty$. We can then consider the low-frequency limit, meaning 
 $\omega \tau_{2} \ll 1$, for which we find
 ```{math}
 \tilde{\mu}(\omega) \approx \mathrm{i} \omega \int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}
 \tau m(\tau) \dd \tau, 
 ```
 and hence that the effective viscosity is given by 
 ```{math}
 \eta = \int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}
 \tau m(\tau) \dd \tau.
 ```
 Similarly, at high-frequencies, $\omega \tau_{1} \gg 1$, such a material behaves 
 elastically with effective modulus
 ```{math}
 \mu = \int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}
  m(\tau) \dd \tau.
 ```
 This shows that the effective elastic modulus and viscosity can 
 still be related by the simple expression 
 ```{math}
 \eta = \mu \bar{\tau}, 
 ```
 where we have defined the average relaxation time
 ```{math}
 \bar{\tau} = \frac{\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}
 \tau m(\tau) \dd \tau}{\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}
  m(\tau) \dd \tau}.
 ```
 

 It should be noted that the above discussion has been 
 limited to **linear rheologies**. For sufficiently large strains or strain-rates, non-linear effects can be relevant and this 
 is likely to be true for certain aspects of mantle 
 dynamics. Accounting for such non-linearity adds complications 
 to the above discussion, but does not alter the main points
 that  have been emphasised. 

### Estimates mantle viscosity

An order of magnitude estimate on the relaxation  time 
for the Earth's mantle can be obtained through the study of 
**glacial isostatic adjustment**. This is the slow process of the Earth's surface rising after the immense weight of an ice sheet is removed, much like a cushion slowly regaining its shape. This process is associated with the deformation 
of the solid Earth and concomitant sea level change associated
with the growth or melting of large ice sheets. There is not 
time to enter into this process in any detail, but observations
linked to the previous glacial period show that the relaxation 
time for the mantle is of order $10^4$ years. 

```{figure} figures/sea_level.png

Past sea level curves from locations 
under the centre of large ice sheets during the last glacial period. 
Since the ice has melted, these regions have undergone
significant uplift, and hence sea level fall, due to 
viscoelastic relaxation of stress. The observed response can 
be well-modelled by an exponential decay, with the 
associated time-scale providing an 
estimate for the mantle's Maxwell time of 
order 5000 years. Figure taken from Peltier (2004)
```


From our previous discussion, we know that mantle viscosity 
is related to the relaxation time through 
```{math}
\eta = \mu \tau, 
```
with $\mu$ an  elastic modulus. An appropriate
value for $\mu$ can be obtained from seismological models 
for the Earth, with $\mu \sim 10^{11}$ Pa being a suitable 
order of magnitude estimate. Recalling that one year is 
around $10^{7}$ s, we find $\eta \sim 10^{21}$ Pa s.
For comparison, this is greater than the viscosity of 
water by twenty one orders of magnitude!

The study of glacial isostatic adjustment can also 
provide more detailed quantitative models 
of viscosity variations within the Earth. For example, 
it has been shown that the viscosity increases by between the 
upper and lower parts of the mantle  by around one order of 
magnitude. Such a change in viscosity is likely 
due to solid-state phase changes within the 
minerals the make up the mantle, and both 
factors have potentially important
effects on spatial pattern of convection. 
Such details are not, however,
vital for our present discussion. 


### Temperature and pressure dependence of viscosity

The viscosity of the mantle is set principally by 
the relaxation time,  with this quantity reflecting the 
aggregate effect of a host of microphysical processes. 
The relaxation time, and hence viscosity, is known to be 
a highly
sensitive function of temperature, $T$,  and pressure, $p$. This 
relation is complicated and not well-determined, but 
a reasonable model is given by 
```{math}
\tau = \tau_{0} \exp\left( \frac{E_{0} + p V_{0}}{k T}\right), 
```
where $E_{0}$ is a reference activation energy,  $V_{0}$ a reference 
volume, and $k$ the Boltzmann constant. For those familiar with 
statistical mechanics, the form of this expression is motivated by 
the Boltzmann distribution, and reflects the 
fact that the microphysical mechanisms require 
energy barriers to be overcome, with the 
probability that this happens being higher 
and higher temperatures.

The strong temperature dependence of viscosity within 
the mantle is central to understanding the Earth's interior dynamics 
along with related processes such as plate tectonics. 
As temperature decreases, relaxation time rises dramatically. 
Within sufficiently cool shallow parts of the Earth, 
the relaxation time can be so great  that the material 
behaves elastically over geological time. This region of the 
Earth is called the **lithosphere**. It is known be around 100 km thick,  comprising the Earth's crust (which has an average thickness of about 35 km) and the upper part of the Mantle. It should be 
emphasised that the crust and mantle are compositionally distinct, with the former having, in broadest outline, formed through partial melting of the latter. The lithosphere, by contrast, is not defined in terms 
of its composition but from its long-term **mechanical behaviour**.


## The Rayleigh number

While a full understanding of mantle convection is rather involved, the main ideas can 
be understood through simple scaling arguments. Convection in the mantle ultimately occurs because 
the Earth's interior is hotter than its exterior, with this difference being due to a combination of 
heat generated during the Earth's formation and that produced subsequently through radioactive decay.

Regions of the mantle that are hotter (colder) than their surroundings
have lower (higher) densities due to thermal expansion and so they experience an upwards (downwards) buoyancy force. 
These buoyancy forces are resisted by the mantle's viscosity. It can be shown -- though analysis of the so-called **Reynolds number**
-- that the viscosity of the mantle is sufficiently great that accelerations are vanishingly small for mantle convection, and hence
at each time there is a near perfect balance between buoyancy forces and viscous resistance to flow. 

Heat can also be transfered within the mantle through thermal diffusion, with heat flowing from hot to cool regions without 
any bulk motion of the fluid. If the time-scale for thermal diffusion is much faster than that associated with fluid flow, 
then a thermal anomaly will diffuse away before any significant motion of the fluid can accumulate. This idea is 
quantified within the **Rayleigh number** that we now derive using a simple scaling argument. 

Consider a region with characteristic length scale $L$  that is temperature $\Delta T$ hotter than its surroundings. 
Associated with this temperature difference, the region has a density anomaly
```{math}
\Delta \rho = -\rho \alpha \Delta T, 
```
where $\rho$ is the background density, and $\alpha$ is the **thermal expansivity**; the negative sign means that 
regions that are hotter, $\Delta T > 0$, have a lower density, $\Delta \rho < 0$, and conversely. The regions 
volume scales like $L^{3}$, and hence the mass anomaly is 
```{math}
\Delta m \sim -\rho \alpha \Delta T L^{3}. 
```
Here we write $\sim$ and not equals to emphasise that this is just a rough estimate and not a precise equality. 
Finally, we multiply by the gravitational acceleration to arrive at the buoyancy force the region experiences
```{math}
 F_{b} \sim -\rho \alpha g  \Delta T L^{3}.
```

The bouancy force is resisted by the viscous resistance to flow. The viscous stress, $\sigma = \eta \dot{epsilon}$, is a
force per unit area, and so we can convert it to a force by multiplying by the boundary of the region whose area 
scales like $L^{2}$:
```{math}
 F_{v} \sim \eta \dot{\epsilon} L^{2}.
```
To proceed, we need to estimate the strain rate, $\dot{\epsilon}$ for the fluid flow. The strain rate is 
a rate of change of velocity with distance, and so we have
```{math}
 \dot{\epsilon} \sim \frac{V}{L}, 
```
where $V$ is the magnitude of the velocity and we assume that the scale-length for the flow is equal to the
characteristic length-scale for the region. Combining with the above estimate we arrive at
```{math}
 F_{v} \sim \eta V L. 
```

We can now equate the magnitudes of the buoyancy and viscous forces to obtain
```{math}
    \rho \alpha g  \Delta T L^{3} \sim \eta V L, 
```
and hence the flow speed scales like
```{math}
    V \sim \frac{\rho \alpha g  \Delta T L^{2}}{\eta}.
```
A time-scale can then be associated with the fluid-flow by setting
```{math}
t_{a} \sim \frac{L}{V} \sim \frac{\eta}{\rho \alpha g  \Delta T L}, 
```
with sub-script $a$ for advection. 

Considering the same region, we can also estimate the time-scale over which is 
would cool by thermal diffusion. First, the total thermal energy associated with 
the region scales like 
```{math}
\Delta E \sim \rho C_{p} \Delta T L^{3}, 
```
where $C_{p}$ is a heat capacity (at constant pressure) measured per unit mass.
If we write $q$ for the heat flux (i.e., flow of energy per unit area per unit time),
then to move all the heat from the region would take a time
```{math}
t_{d} \sim \frac{\rho C_{p} \Delta T L^{3}}{q L^{2}} \sim \frac{\rho C_{p} \Delta T L}{q},
```
with subscript $d$ for diffusion. To simplify further, we need to use **Fourier's law** which 
states that the heat flux is proportional to the negative of the temperature gradient. 
This leads to the following scaling estimate for magnitudes
```{math}
q \sim k \frac{\Delta T}{L}, 
```
where $k$ is the materials **thermal conductivity**. We can now simplify our expression for $t_{d}$
to yield
```{math}
t_{d} \sim \frac{\rho C_{p}  L^{2}}{k} \sim \frac{ L^{2}}{\kappa},  
```
where in the final equality we have introduced the *thermal diffusivity* which is defined by 
```{math}
\kappa = \frac{k}{\rho C_{p}}.
```

We now have scaling estimates for the time-scales linked to advection, $t_{a}$, and diffusion, $t_{d}$, 
and combining these we arrive at the dimensionless Rayleigh number:
```{math}
\mathrm{Ra} \sim \frac{t_{d}}{t_{a}}  \sim \frac{\rho \alpha g  \Delta T L^{3}}{\kappa \eta }
```
A key observation is that the Rayleigh number's dependence
on the length-scale goes like $L^{3}$. This shows that
relative importance of advection is larger for 
larger anomalies. It follows that if convective 
instabilities most readily occur at the largest 
possible length-scales.


A limitation of our simple scaling analysis is that 
we cannot know how large the Rayleigh number 
need be for the onset of convection.   However, this quantity
also occurs within   a **linearised stability analysis** of the 
governing equations. There is not time to 
cover these details, but they show that 
when the Rayleigh number is larger than 
some critical value, $\mathrm{Ra}_{c}$, convection will occur.
The precise value depends on the geometry considered, 
but $\mathrm{Ra}_{c} \sim 10^{3}$ is a representative value. 



The above analysis can now be applied to the Earth's mantle 
to assess whether it is likely to undergo convection. In doing this,
 it makes sense  to choose the length-scale of the flow to be as large
as possible, and so we take $L$ to be the thickness 
of the mantle. Experiments on mantle minerals show 
that $\alpha \sim 10^{-5}$ K $^{-1}$ is an 
appropriate estimate. Determining a sensible 
value for $\Delta T$, which can be viewed as the 
temperature difference from the bottom to 
top of the mantle, is more difficult. Instead, 
we will determine what temperature difference across the 
mantle would be required for convection to occur, and 
 then consider if such a value seems plausible. 
Solving  for $\Delta T$ within the Rayleigh number, we find
```{math}
\Delta T \sim  \frac{\kappa \eta \mathrm{Ra}_{c}}{\rho \alpha g L^{3}}  \sim \frac{10^{-6} 10^{21} 10^{3}}{10^{3} 10^{-5} 10^{1} 10^{18}}\, \mathrm{K} \sim 1 \,\mathrm{K}
```
Here we see that a temperature difference of order only one Kelvin would be sufficient for the mantle to convect! Given other 
geological information (volcanism, geothermal heat, radioactive heating) it is entirely implausible that the temperature difference across
the mantle is smaller than this value, and hence convection 
must certainly occur.

show non-dimensional temperatures. For the lowest
Rayleigh number, lying just above the critical value, large
scale convection cells form that undergo a quasi-steady flow. For 
larger values of the Rayleigh number, the convective patterns
are more complicated, involve a range of length-scales, 
and are  and strongly time-dependent. Figure taken from Ricard (2007).
```

In fact, plausible estimates for the mantle's 
Rayleigh number are typically of order $10^{6}-10^{7}$, and so around
one thousand times larger than the critical value. At such high
Rayleigh numbers, instabilities are not limited to the largest 
possible length-scales. Instead, complicated and time-dependent 
patterns of convection spanning a range of length-scales must occur. 


## Consequences of convection at the Earth's surface

To conclude this lecture, we consider two
consequences of mantle convection that are observable at the 
Earth's surface, namely **gravity anomalies** and **dynamic 
topography**. These are not the only surface features 
linked to mantle convection, but most others on Earth are 
associated with to **plate tectonics**. Whether or not an
Earth-like planet has plate tectonics, we would expect there
to be gravity anomalies and dynamic topography linked to 
convection within its interior. Convection within the mantle is, however, not the only nor the dominant process that can produce gravity anomalies or  topography on a planet's surface, and hence there are significant  challenges to using such observations in practice. 

### Gravity anomalies

If the Earth did not convect and if it was entirely fluid
over geological time, then it would have an ellipsoidal 
equilibrium figure, with the surface being an 
equipotential of the **gravity potential** (i.e., the sum
of the gravitational and centrifugal potentials). 
As we have seen, the lithosphere is sufficiently cool 
to behave elastically over geological time, with this layer
supporting both topography and lateral density contrasts that 
have been generated by a host of processes. Moreover, 
convection within the mantle is driven by density anomalies
whose gravitational signal can be felt at the surface, 


```{figure} figures/geoid.png
---
name: fig:02geoid
---

Variations in the gravitational potential at the Earth's 
surface expressed as the equivalent **geoid anomaly**. The 
latter quantity can be understood as the change in the position 
of the mean sea level associated with the gravitational potential 
perturbation. The observed geoid anomaly reflects contributions throughout
the whole Earth, but it is only at the longest wavelengths
that the effects of mantle convection can be seen.
```



### Dynamic topography

Convection in the mantle applies a force at the base of the 
lithosphere. In areas of upgoing flow, the lithosphere, and hence 
the Earth's surface, is deflected upwards, and conversely in 
areas of downgoing flow. The resulting topography at the 
Earth's surface is known as **dynamic topography**, with 
this term being identical to that used within oceanography
for deflections of the sea surface linked to large-scale
ocean currents. Note that the deflection of the 
internal and external boundaries linked to mantle 
flow contributes directly to the associated gravity anomaly. 

The elastic lithosphere acts as a low-pass filter on the forces applied to its base.  As a result, dynamic topography is largest at long-wavelengths and is not appreciable at scales smaller than 
the lithospheric thickness. The amplitude of dynamic topography 
can be estimated using simple scaling arguments or through 
more sophisticated modelling. The result is that amplitudes of 
order 1 km might be expected at wavelengths of 1000 km.

Observations of dynamic topography for transect
along the margin of Western Africa. These observations
are obtained by correcting the observed topography for 
processes such as sedimentation. The amplitude 
of the dynamic topography is 1 km, and the horizontal 
wavelength is of order 1000 km.  Figure from Holdt *et al.* (2022).
```

Observations of dynamic topography can be made on the Earth, 
but the process is complicated by the need to remove other sources
of topography. This correction is significantly easier 
within the oceans, and as a result most observational models 
are limited to this region.
