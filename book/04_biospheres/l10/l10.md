```{highlights}

**Learning objectives:**
- To understand how land plant evolution influenced Earth's climate and oxygenation state	
- To understand how weathering intensity changed in synchrony with evolving land plants
- To understand the sedimentological impact of evolving land plants

```

## The Paleozoic greening of the continents
- First roots: Lower Devonian 
- First wood: Lower Devonian
- First trees: Middle Devonian
- First forests: Middle Devonian
- Important expansion and diversification of ‘the critical zone’ (Part 2)
- The critical zone is the living boundary layer where rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms interact. These complex interactions regulate the natural habitat and determine the availability of life-sustaining resources.

Plants now dominate terrestrial biomass. Consequently, surface processes on Earth are always impacted by vegetation, either directly or indirectly. [Bar-on et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1711842115).

### Pre-Vegetation Earth Alluvium:
- 1000’s metres of sands
- Almost no mud
- Architectural elements = dominantly tabular sandstones
- Laterally mobile channels $\pm$ high aspect ratios

Increase in Lateral Accretion Sets following the evolution of land plants
- Stabilized by roots?
- Stabilized by above-ground plant effects (‘baffling’)?
- More mud?

### Unvegetated Martian meanders

- Lower acceleration due to gravity reduces the flow resistance to maintain a single threaded river(?)
- More cohesive mud in hydrologically closed impact crater basins(?)
- Scale differences(?)
- Incorrect interpretations of pre-vegetation Earth alluvium(?)

## Plants intensify chemical weathering

Plants alter the terrestrial silicate weathering feedback – one of the dominant cycles which regulates temperature on Earth. The basic idea of this feedback is that any increases in CO$_2$ lead to increased surface temperatures, acceleration of the hydrological cycle, and larger fluxes of silicate chemical weathering, which in turn lead to greater CO$_2$ removal from the ocean-atmosphere system through continental weathering.
